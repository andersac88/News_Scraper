# [News Scraper](https://political-scraper.herokuapp.com/)

### About
This is an web application that is designed around the npm Cheerio. When a user click's 'Scrape', articles from [Political Wire](www.politicalwire.com) are displayed and added to a mongo database. 

Users can then add notes to the various articles and view those left by others. After six hours, the displayed articles will be archived and users will be asked to perform another scrape. Past articles are still available to users by clicking on 'All Articles'
